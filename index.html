        The man himself on the cover of his book Pandeymonium
        <p>
          Piyush Pandey is a creative legend who redefined every aspect of
          Indian advertisement industry with his genuinely out_of_TheBox thought
          process.. In the History of Modern Independent India, his name will be
          commemorated with great honor. He is More than just a man who helped
          businesses to brand and rebrand. He showed the world, how power of art
          can inspire and change the life of billions. The
          <strong>Polio eradication campaign</strong> in India under his
          creative skills have proven to be one of the most successful social
          campaigns held in any country. As a result India became, a 100% Polio
          free nation. In this tribute page, I'm listing down some of his works
          which are my personal favourites----> Enjoy!
